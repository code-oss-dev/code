			Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor which
			runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, Mac and Linux. It comes
			with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich
			ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Python, PHP)
			and runtimes. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The editor includes built-in support for the Git distributed version control
			system, intelligent code completion, support for highlighting and completing
			many programming languages, and and integrated debugging interface. Additional
			functionality is provided by optional extensions.
